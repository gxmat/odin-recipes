      Semiya payasam is a creamy, sweet vermicelli pudding from the South Indian
      cuisine. This cardamom scented vermicelli payasam comes together in 20
      minutes and can be made by beginners too. Being so easy, you can make it
      any day when you fancy something sweet or for any festive or religious
      occasion. I share both stove-top and Instant pot method for making this
      delicious semiya payasam recipe.

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <p>
      Any payasam can be made in the Instant pot. Follow the steps listed below
      to make this vermicelli payasam in your IP. Use the same proportions of
      ingredients as mentioned in the stove-top recipe.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Frying nuts:</strong> Press the sauté button of your IP. When
        you see the “hot” display on the screen, add ghee. Let it melt. Add the
        cashews and stirring often fry them until golden. Remove and set aside.
        Tip in the raisins and fry them until they swell. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roasting Vermicelli:</strong> Add the vermicelli. Stirring
        non-stop roast them until golden. If the heat becomes too much, then
        press the sauté button to get the “less” option.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Pressure cooking:</strong> Add milk and sugar. Close the lid and
        position the pressure valve to sealing position. Press the porridge
        button and set the time to 7 minutes on high pressure. When the cooking
        is done (after you hear the Instant pot beep), give a quick pressure
        release after 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finishing touches:</strong> Open the lid carefully. Add the
        cardamom powder and the fried cashews and raisins. Mix and stir. If the
        consistency is thin for your liking, then using the sauté function,
        simmer for a couple of minutes.
      </li>
