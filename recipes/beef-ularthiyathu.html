      Beef is best savored among Malayalees in a fry or roast (ularthiyathu) preparation. The country style beef roast, cooked in iron pans with a lot of curry leaves bring out a unique flavour and aroma which tastes beyond words! The best combination with beef roast is a side of Kerala Porottas; a layered flat bread made with flour. Beef dishes with porotta are very popular among the street foods of Kerala; it is such an exquisite dish that, be it a road side stall or a star hotel, you will find the same love and authenticity given to its preparation. And not to mention, Iâ€™ve heard that the Toddy shops serve yummilicious beef dishes that taste from out of this world!!
